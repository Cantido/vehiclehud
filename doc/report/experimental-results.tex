\chapter{Experimental Results}

% At some point you will have to determine whether your project works. This
% section should detail the design of the testing experiments, the results of
% the testing, and comments regarding whether the project does what it is
% supposed to do.  Elements that are hard to test and aspects of the project
% that do not pass the tests should be highlighted.  The design of the
% experiments is worth some space as well, as there are design tradeoffs and
% decisions to be discussed here as well as for the project itself.  Any data
% should be included in tables or charts in this section or in an appendix if
% it is particularly cumbersome.
