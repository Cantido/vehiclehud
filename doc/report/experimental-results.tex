\chapter{Experimental Results}

% At some point you will have to determine whether your project works. This
% section should detail the design of the testing experiments, the results of
% the testing, and comments regarding whether the project does what it is
% supposed to do.  Elements that are hard to test and aspects of the project
% that do not pass the tests should be highlighted.  The design of the
% experiments is worth some space as well, as there are design tradeoffs and
% decisions to be discussed here as well as for the project itself.  Any data
% should be included in tables or charts in this section or in an appendix if
% it is particularly cumbersome.

\section{Introduction}

How well the HUD system works overall is a qualitative judgement, for the most
part, and we decided the system was complete when we could drive around with it.
However, we did have some requirements on performance for the power suppy unit, as well
as for the OBD subsystem.

\section{OBD}

The refresh rate of vehicle data on the display is our core measurement of
performance for this subsystem. Overall, it seems that we can request a value
from the vehicle and place it on the display in around 100 milliseconds. This
is fast enough to seem as responsive as the vehicle's needles.

However, response times vary depending on the internal protocol of the vehicle's
electronics system.
