\chapter{Budget}

% Compare the actual costs of the materials and supplies with those in the
% proposal.  A table with all costs should be included here or in an appendix.
% Very brief discussion is appropriate here if you had significant cost
% overruns or savings.

Table~\ref{tab:budget} itemizes the total budget for the project. A total of
\$1223.35 was spent during development, however much of this is due to
large bulk purchases of parts, and extra odds and ends kept by both members of
the project team for later projects. This list is exhaustive, not representative of
the cost of our final product.

The main board and power supply board proved to be the biggest expenditure.
We purchased three copies of each board, and purchased lots of extra parts in
bulk. This proved useful, as we had a board short-circuit and needed to replace
it, but the point still stands that we spent close to \$600 on the boards alone.

Table~\ref{tab:product} itemizes the cost of the system. With a final cost
of \$364.21, our system ends up under-budget by \$35.79.
