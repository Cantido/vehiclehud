\chapter{Project Objectives}

Beyond the straightforward goal of making our system display vehicle data, we
set goals that could set our project apart from other systems.

\section{Universality}

Our system only needs to interface in two places with the vehicle:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The OBD jack
\item The power supply

\end{enumerate}

Both of these interfaces are based on very solid standards. The OBD-II protocol
is well-documented and, by law, must be implemented by every vehicle made
today. An automobile's power supply is similarly standardized and
well-documented.

\section{Display Collimation}

It is a common practice in projected heads-up displays to ``collimate'' the
light. That means that the light has been focused such that the rays of light
are parallel, also called ``focused at infinity.'' This is done to avoid
causing eye strain due to the user focusing back and forth between the
environment and the display. Our system performs this task.
