\chapter{Project Specifications}

% As in the previous section, these come mostly from the proposal and any
% deviations from the proposal must be explained.  

% The specifications include a lot of technical details:  sizes, weights,
% operational requirements, materials, costs, etc.  You may divide these into
% sections and put the details themselves in a well-formatted table, but you
% must also include at least a paragraph per section describing why these
% specifications were chosen and how they relate to the goals of the project.  

% You will find as you get into the writing of this that your ability to
% understand and explain the project increases. This makes your work more
% accessible and, since it can be communicated, more likely to actually have a
% technological impact.

% This section should be 1-3 pages in length.
