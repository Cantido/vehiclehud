\chapter{Timeline and Deliverables}

% A simple and straightforward section to write, this should include the
% timeline from the proposal as well as the actual timeline used along with
% milestones met, not met, and altered.  A list of deliverables promised and
% delivered should be included.  Discussion here should run a few paragraphs
% and reflect your team's experiences with the schedule: were some parts of it
% rushed, did your original chart give too much time for one aspect, were some
% tasks crashed or done in parallel, etc.
