\section{Project Team}

With only two members on our team, communication is very simple. We have
decided on a simple hardware/software split in responsibilities, and we
share information on a regular basis.

\subsection{Aaron Hall (\texttt{ach6r5@mst.edu}; EE and CpE Double Major)}

Aaron will be the team leader for the project. He will be responsible for
the hardware and mechanical portions of the project. He will handle
schematic design, PCB layout, board fabrication, and mechanical
design/fabrication. Aaron has had multiple internships in the automotive
industry and is an avid automotive hobbyist.

\subsection{Robert Richter (\texttt{rcrvy4@mst.edu}; CpE Major)}

Robert will be responsible for programming and the hardware/software
interface. He has completed a minor in Computer Science and is programming
microcontrollers for S\&T's Mars Rover Design Team. For the HUD project he
will be working with some of the same components that that design team is
using.
